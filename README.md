Add secrets through the web interface in your app settings.

### Customization Options
- Temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Caching duration (configurable TTL)
- Weather code descriptions (WMO codes)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Location not detected**
   - **Automatic detection**: Check internet connection and browser location permissions
   - **Manual search**: Try different location formats (city, state, country)
   - **Fallback**: Use the text search if geolocation fails

2. **API errors**
   - **Weather data**: Verify internet connection and API availability
   - **API keys**: Ensure OpenAI and SerpAPI keys are correctly set in secrets
   - **Quota limits**: Check API usage and billing status
   - **Rate limiting**: Wait a few minutes before retrying

3. **Forecast generation issues**
   - **Insufficient data**: Ensure location has enough historical weather data
   - **Streamlit caching**: Clear browser cache if forecasts seem outdated
   - **Model training**: Wait for ML model to complete training (may take 30-60 seconds)

4. **No events found**
   - **SerpAPI key**: Verify SerpAPI key is valid and active
   - **Location**: Check if the location has available events
   - **API limits**: Ensure SerpAPI quota hasn't been exceeded

5. **Performance issues**
   - **Slow loading**: Historical data fetching can take time (up to 1 year of data)
   - **Memory usage**: Large datasets may require more memory
   - **Caching**: First load is slower; subsequent loads use cached data

### Recent Fixes

- **Streamlit caching error**: Fixed "Cannot hash argument 'self'" error in WeatherHistoricalAnalyzer
- **Location search**: Added manual location search as fallback for geolocation
- **Error handling**: Improved error messages and graceful degradation
- **Session management**: Enhanced state persistence across user interactions

### Error Messages
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Debug information**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Graceful fallbacks**: App continues to function even with API failures
- **Status indicators**: Visual feedback for loading states and errors
